## The deployer of worlds

`krishna` is a simple set of helper scripts for managing software 
deployment through git hooks.

## Installation

Add the following to your .git/config on the server:

    [receive]
        denycurrentbranch = ignore

Symlink the git hooks in place:

    $ cd $REPO/.git/hooks
    $ ln -s ../../deployer/pre-receive .
    $ ln -s ../../deployer/post-update .

Customise the `deploy` script to do what you need.
